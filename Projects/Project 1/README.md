However you can not move a bigger disk onto a smaller disk. In order to do this you are given a spare pole to put disks onto. This game does keep track of your score by counting the number of moves it takes to completely move the tower.

## Instructions
It is strongly recommended to run this project in netbeans external terminal since it has console colors. The game begins by asking how many disks you want to play with.

You will then be asked if you want to go in guided mode, which will tell you the correct steps for a perfect game. It is not recommended if you have a large number of disks such as 64 unless you want to wait for a hundred years.

The the game will then begin, and you will see the poles in a vertical layout with alphabetical names. The disks size are denoted by numbers, one being the smallest disk. It will then ask you to enter the character of the pole you want to move from and then where you want to move it. These can be uppercase or lowercase. Should you want to exit the game cleanly anytime during the game put z as the destination pole.

Once you win the game it will display your scores and will ask you if you want to play again
