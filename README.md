# CSC 17c: C++ Data Structures
This course is a 16-week class that uses web technology to provide you with a flexible learning option. An on-line class also gives you access to a wide range of information resources and allows you to study when it is most convenient for you. This type of class may be new to you. While you will enjoy greater flexibility in scheduling your study time, you will need to be self motivated and disciplined in setting your study schedule, completing course requirements, and exploring background resources. 

## Course Objectives

1. Analyze and understand the use of data structures in the development of algorithms.

2. Design and create C++ programs using stacks, trees, queues, lists and trees.

3. Apply theoretical business, scientific, and mathematical concepts to write and execute computer programs in the C++ language using data structures.

4. Analyze application requirements to identify data structures with matching capabilities.
